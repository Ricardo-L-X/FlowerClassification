# FlowerClassification
a little task when learning Pytorch

the environment is very brief:

    conda create -n flowerclassification python=3.8.0
    conda activate flowerclassification
    pip install torch

    some other packages according to the "flower_division.ipynb"

this project runs on MacbookPro with M2, so I use the "mps" instead of "cuda"
